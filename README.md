Voice Assistant: Wall-E 1.0
Overview
Wall-E 1.0 is a Python-based voice assistant that can perform a variety of tasks, such as searching the web, sending emails, playing music, giving jokes, capturing photos, and much more. It is also integrated with WolframAlpha for calculations and Googleâ€™s Generative AI model for generating responses based on user queries.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install wolframalpha pyttsx3 wikipedia pyjokes winshell feedparser smtplib requests speech_recognition twilio clint ecapture BeautifulSoup4 pyaudio google-generativeai
Note: You may need additional system-specific packages for some functionalities, such as pyaudio and winshell.

Usage
Configure API Keys

WolframAlpha: Replace the app_id variable in the code with your WolframAlpha API key.
Google Generative AI: Replace the api_key variable with your API key from Google.
Run the Program

Once all dependencies are installed and API keys are configured, you can run the assistant with:
